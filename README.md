# gramene-ebeye
This software is a web service that furnishes an ensembl installation with search results. It acts as an intermediary between the Ensembl instance and an instance of [gramene-swagger](warelab/gramene-swagger).

This repo is using Travis CI for testing (though tests are limited to unit tests of the code that tranliterates between Ensembl and the web service). Current status: ![Current Status](https://travis-ci.org/warelab/gramene-ebeye.svg?branch=master)
